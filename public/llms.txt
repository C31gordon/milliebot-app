3. **Industry-specific** — Pre-built agents and workflows for property management, healthcare, and construction. Not generic automation.
4. **Open-core** — Free integration walkthroughs. Pro adds managed credentials. Enterprise adds pre-built OAuth connectors.
5. **Model-flexible** — Choose between Anthropic, OpenAI, or open-source models. Control your AI costs.
