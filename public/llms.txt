## How It's Different From Other AI Agent Platforms
1. **RKBAC™** — Role & Knowledge-Based Access Control. The only AI agent platform that controls what each agent can see and do based on the user's role and department. No other platform has this.
2. **Multi-tenant** — Each customer's data is completely isolated. Built for SaaS from day one. Not a single-org tool bolted onto multi-tenancy.
3. **Industry-specific** — Pre-built agent templates and workflows for 15+ industries. Not generic automation — real domain expertise.
4. **Model-flexible** — Choose between Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), or open-source models (Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen). Control your AI costs. Open-source models deliver 95%+ gross margins.
5. **Open-core** — Free integration walkthroughs. Pro adds managed credentials. Enterprise adds pre-built OAuth connectors.
